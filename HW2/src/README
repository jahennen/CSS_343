CSS 343 Assignment 2 Submission README

Author: Jay Hennen

The BTree is self-contained in BTree.h, along with the TreeNode class itself.
The TreeNode class is NOT contained in the BTree class. I found it easier to
work with by doing it in this way, and doesn't really affect the final product.
BTree deletion IS fully implemented, mainly because of available free time and
probable masochism. is_empty() was added public because of it's
obvious usefulness in code clarity and functionality.

btreetest.cpp is the test program. It creates an array of SIZE and populates it
with random integers, which are then added in order and then deleted in reverse
order. Checks for complete tree deletion and outputs counter data to check case 
coverage.  

The wordcount program uses the same rules as the wordcount program from
assignment 1, just updated to use c++ style strings. A separate class Strmap
(with it's own source/header files) are used to provide map functionality to the
BTree.

The dedup program uses the BTree to solve the set aspect of the posed problem
and simply writes input lines directly to output if they do not exist in the
set. As no example was given regarding any special output formatting, the simplest
option was opted for.
